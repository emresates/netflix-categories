## Netflix Categories Page

##### I designed Netflix homepage before. Now I wanted to make the cageroies section. I hope you like it

##### Netflix shows categories on homepage irregularly. If you want to find something as a category, you have to type it in the search bar. But in my design you are redirected to a separate page. 

### I designed this with Html, Css and Javascript. 

##### It wasn't very challenging. It took a long time to enter the poster's informations one by one. 

##### When you click on the category you want, it brings up the movies/series that belong to that category. A-Z button shows all posters alphabetically.
